## Introduction

Monica is an open-source web application to organize the interactions with your loved ones. I call it a PRM, or Personal Relationship Management. Think of it as a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) (a popular tool used by sales teams in the corporate world) for your friends or family.

Chandler is the [Monica](https://github.com/monicahq/monica) mobile app.
